# Tube Clock
## Clock in perpex tube

This clock was build to fit in a perpex tube and to indicate the time in text instead of numbers.
It also displays the weather and the latest news in a ticker mode fashion.
Currently it displays the time in Dutch language, but that could easily be adapted to other languages
